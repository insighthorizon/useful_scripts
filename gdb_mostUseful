when compiling, create gdb symbols in executable: g++ -g main.cpp (the -g option)
run gdb: gdb ./a.out
set breakpoint: break filename:linenumber (break main.cpp:41)
start debugging: run
show local variables with their values: info locals
step through lines of code: step
continue running to next breakpoint or end of program: continue
show breakpoints: info break
delete breakpoint: del 1 (1 is index of breakpoint)
